            <li>To play click on the Start New Game button.</li>

            <li>Choose one of the 10 light blue buttons to be your suitcase that you may choose to hold until the end of
                the game.</li>

            <li>Then choose another button, which corresponds to opening a suitcase with a certain money amount.</li>

            <li>Then choose between Deal or opening another suitcase. If you choose Deal, then the game ends and you win

                offer.</li>

            <li>Continue in this fashion until you choose Deal or until you have opened all the suitcases, in which you
                will win the amount that is in the suitcase you chose at the beginning of the game.</li>

            <li>To play another game, just click on the Start New Game button again.</li>
